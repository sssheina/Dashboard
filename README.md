## About this Page

Dashboard page in Belarusian that displays task data in a beautiful and convenient way. The data is stored in JSON. When developing, 3 libraries were used: Moment.js, Chart.js, Anime.js 

The app was created as part of a training project.

<br>

## Inspiration for the Page

I wanted to give meaning and idea to this project, so I made it in Belarusian to increase the visibility and accessibility of this language on the web.

## Challenges I ran into

I wanted to implement this project as best I could. I had a hard time finding a way to translate the date into Belarusian, but I'm glad I did it!
